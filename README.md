Imagine you are a Data Analyst @ Airbnb
You've been asked to analyze user survey data and report NPS to the management

This is called Likelyhood to Recommend Survey

Responses are given a scale ranging from 0–10,
with 0 labeled with “Not at all likely,” and
10 labeled with “Extremely likely.”
Based on this, we calculate the Net Promoter score



We label our responses into 3 categories:

Detractors: Respondents with a score of 0-6
Passive: Respondents with a score of 7-8
Promoters: score of 9-10.
And

Net Promoter score = % Promoters - % Detractors.
